This study examines designers’ strategies in response to the threat from the introduction of an AI system for simple logo designs in a crowdsourcing design platform. We find that, although designers with lower abilities are more likely to exit the platform, designers with higher abilities move away from the locus of threat in the lower-tier contests and switch to more-complex design contests after the introduction of the AI system. More interestingly, we find that, although unsuccessful designers respond to the threat from AI by increasing their participation across multiple contests, successful designers become more focused (i.e., they substantially increase the number of submissions within a contest) and more quality oriented (i.e., they increase emotional content and complexity of their designs) after the AI launch. Our findings show how designers can learn from the behaviors of the more successful designers to differentiate themselves from AI systems by leveraging the more-abstract design attributes. Platform operators would benefit from adopting better segmentations strategies: with AI solutions for simple design tasks, hybrid AI + human solutions for less-complex design tasks, and skilled human designers competing primarily for the more-complex design tasks. </jats:p>",

How insightful are reviews of physicians on a physician review website to potential patients when the ratings cluster tightly around an average for all physicians? Are there costs to the physicians, the patients, and to society as a whole? When all the students at a university score “A” grades on most courses, are there consequences for the university, the students, and potential employers? This paper calls the “clustering around a mean” phenomenon “information compression” and the systems in which it occurs (e.g., universities, students, employers) “judgment networks.” When there is extensive information compression in a system, measures such as ratings or grades have little value for decision makers. When all five-star hotels in a city score an average of 4.5 does it really matter which one a traveler chooses? The paper introduces a way of measuring information compression. It also suggests ways for organizations to overcome the negative consequences of information compression for themselves and their various stakeholders.</jats:p>",
