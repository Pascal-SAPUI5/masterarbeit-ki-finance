Given the recurring cycles in the AI history, we expect that a revamp of technologies often tagged as “classical AI”—in particular,<jats:italic>logic-based</jats:italic>ones—will take place in the next few years. On the other hand, agents and<jats:italic>multi-agent systems</jats:italic>(MAS) have been at the core of the design of intelligent systems since their very beginning, and their long-term connection with<jats:italic>logic-based technologies</jats:italic>, which characterised their early days, might open new ways to engineer<jats:italic>explainable intelligent systems</jats:italic>. This is why understanding the current status of<jats:italic>logic-based technologies for MAS</jats:italic>is nowadays of paramount importance. Accordingly, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive view of those technologies by making them the subject of a<jats:italic>systematic literature review</jats:italic>(SLR). The resulting technologies are discussed and evaluated from two different perspectives: the MAS and the logic-based ones.</jats:p>",
